# New to Flutter?
Let's get started with setting up the workspace and installations.

## System Requirement
To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

* **Operating Systems:** MacOS,Linux (64-bit) or Windows // We'll be working on rhel-8

* **Disk Space:** 600 MB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools).

* **Tools:** Flutter depends on these command-line tools being available in your environment like bash, curl, 
file, git 2.x, mkdir, rm, unzip, which, xz-utils, zip

* **Shared libraries:** Flutter test command depends on this library being available in your environment.

* **libGLU.so.1 -** provided by mesa packages such as libglu1-mesa on Ubuntu/Debian and mesa-libGLU on Fedora.

## Installing Rhel-8
Download rhel-8 from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nZVXCVOy41LjAyOAiHMcNgFIwUlJYw16/view).

Also follow this amazing [rhel installation tutorial](https://youtu.be/JBNvnINsswo) by the founder of Linux World and RHCSA-level-22 Mr. [Vimal Daga](https://in.linkedin.com/in/vimaldaga) for technical insights while installation.

## Get the Flutter SDK
1.  Download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux)
2.  Extract the file in the desired location, for example:
```
$ cd ~/development
$ tar xf ~/Downloads/flutter_linux_1.17.5-stable.tar.xz
```
3.  Add the flutter tool to your path:
```
$ export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```

This command sets your PATH variable for the current terminal window only.
To make it permanent and run flutter commands in any terminal session follow next steps for modifying 
this variable permanently for all terminal sessions are machine-specific. 
Typically you add a line to a file that is executed whenever you open a new window. For example:

1. Determine the directory where you placed the Flutter SDK. You need this in Step 3.
2. Open (or create) the rc file for your shell. For example, Linux uses the Bash shell by default, so edit $HOME/.bashrc. If you are using a different shell, the file path and filename will be different on your machine.
3. Add the following line and change [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] to be the path where you cloned Flutter’s git repo:
```
$ export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
```
4. Run ```source $HOME/.<rc file>``` to refresh the current window, or open a new terminal window to automatically source the file.
Else you can also do the same thing in /etc/profile if you have administrator privileges.

## Android Setup

Flutter relies on a full installation of Android Studio to supply its Android platform dependencies like emulator. However, you can write your Flutter apps in a number of editors; a later step discusses where we'll be writing in VSCode and use the emulator of android studio.
1.  Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads).
2.  Start Android Studio, and go through the ‘Android Studio Setup Wizard’. This installs the latest Android SDK, Android SDK Command-line Tools, and Android SDK Build-Tools, which are required by Flutter when developing for Android.
